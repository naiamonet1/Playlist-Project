You’re working on building out a prototype for a user interface (“UI”) that
will bring YouTube Playlist management to foldable smartphones! The UI is
currently limited so you want to build out something basic, that does not take
up too much vertical space.
Your program will let a user sign in with their username and password (up to 3
attempts before they’re locked out). Then, you will display a Playlist Homepage
that shows all of the user’s playlists and some playlist information.
A user can pick a certain playlist to view and potentially modify. Playlists can
be long so you can only show five of a contained playlist’s videos at a time.
Then, a user can choose to shuffle the playlist or shorten it, if they choose to do
so.
A user can keep going back to modify one of their playlists again and again, or
exit the app altogether.
